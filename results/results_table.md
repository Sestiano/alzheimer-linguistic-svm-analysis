## Critical Overfitting Assessment

### Severe Overfitting (Reduced TF-IDF)
- **Perfect accuracy** (100%) with minimal features indicates memorization
- **65% data loss** during preprocessing suggests aggressive filtering
- **Minimal support vectors** (19) for 277 training samples
- **Conclusion**: Results unreliable for generalization

### High Overfitting Risk (Full TF-IDF & Combined)
- **Very high accuracies** (97.33%, 99.70%) unusual for medical classification
- **High-dimensional features** relative to training data size
- **Dataset filtering bias** may select easier-to-classify documents
- **Single train/test split** insufficient for robust evaluation

### Low Overfitting Risk (Linguistic Only)
- **Moderate accuracy** (62.32%) suggests appropriate model complexity
- **Single feature** provides minimal capacity for memorization
- **Complete dataset** processed without filtering bias
- **High support vector count** indicates difficulty fitting, not overfitting

## Trustworthiness Ranking

1. **Linguistic Only** - Most trustworthy results
2. **Full TF-IDF** - Moderate trust, needs validation
3. **Combined** - Promising but requires validation
4. **Reduced TF-IDF** - Untrustworthy due to severe overfitting

### Revised Conclusions

**Research Question**: "Can a single linguistic feature achieve comparable performance to full TF-IDF vectors?"

**Critical Answer**: When accounting for overfitting concerns, the linguistic feature provides the most reliable performance baseline:

**Linguistic Feature Advantages**:
- **Trustworthy results**: 62.32% accuracy with minimal overfitting risk
- **Complete interpretability**: Clinicians can understand and explain the feature
- **Robust evaluation**: Processes complete dataset without filtering bias
- **Clinical relevance**: Captures known language degradation patterns

**High-Accuracy Approaches Concerns**:
- **Overfitting indicators**: Very high accuracies (97.33%, 99.70%, 100%) raise reliability concerns
- **Validation needed**: Results require cross-validation before clinical deployment
- **Dataset bias**: Vocabulary filtering may inflate performance estimates

**Recommendation**: 
1. **For immediate clinical use**: Linguistic feature approach provides most trustworthy foundation
2. **For research development**: Combined approach requires rigorous validation to address overfitting concerns
3. **Avoid**: Reduced TF-IDF approach due to severe overfitting

**Clinical Deployment Strategy**: Start with interpretable linguistic features, then carefully validate complex approaches through proper cross-validation protocols.
